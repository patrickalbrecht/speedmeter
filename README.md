# speedmeter
Meteor-React demo application, to demonstrate how easy it is to create a very fast web- and ios/android app.

## Usage
Select a speed difference you want to measure. After you have chosen the measurement type, simply get below the start speed - if not so already - and accelerate.

The measurement will automatically start and stop after you have reached the target speed.
After the measurement, you can save your time and add a comment to it.

##Contribution
This is a beginner app, and so am I in the field of meteor and react. Feel free to comment on things to improve my code, but please be constructive!
Pull requests are welcome.

##Excalimer
Please beware that the app is currently still in development.
At this time you are able to push all kinds of times to the database, because there is no validation included yet.
Please also note, that depending on the gps accuracy, the measured times can vary and not represent the actual time needed.
